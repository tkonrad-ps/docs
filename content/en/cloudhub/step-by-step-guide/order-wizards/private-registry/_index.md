## Introduction

Welcome to the Private Registry order wizard. Here it is described which configuration options are available and how a new Private Registry can be ordered.

In the following we guide you step by step through the ordering process and explain the individual selection options and input fields.

The Private Registry is based on Harbor, a cloudnative open source registry for container images.
