In the following we guide you step by step through the ordering process and explain the individual selection options and input fields.

## Step 2: Email for provision information

- Email address:
    This field is prefilled with the email address with which you are currently registered.
    However, the address can be adjusted if necessary.

## Workload Protection as a Service

A security service for expanding your PSKE platform with comprehensive protection for applications, containers and infrastructure, which can be selected with a chop in the checkbox.

Performance features:

- Monitoring of images & containers (weakness analysis)
- Runtime protection (e.g. XDR, file monitoring)
- Scans of source code & infrastructure as code (Devsecops, IAC)
- Compliance & auditing of configurations
- Platform protection (e.g. AWS)
- SOC integration *(on request) *: 24x7 monitoring by a team of analysts with recommendations for action in cyber attacks

## Step 5: SOC Integration *(Coming Soon)*

The 24x7 SoC integration is not yet available.
In the future, it will enable monitoring by our team of analysts to recognize and react early.
