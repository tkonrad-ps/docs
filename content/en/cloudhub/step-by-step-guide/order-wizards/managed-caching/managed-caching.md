## Introduction

Welcome to the Managed Caching order wizard. Here it is described which configuration options are available and how a new Managed Caching can be ordered.

In the following we guide you step by step through the ordering process and explain the individual selection options and input fields.

The Managed Caching is based on Valkey, a scalable and powerful in-memory database that is optimized for fast data processing and caching solutions.

## Step 1: Select instance type

Select the desired ratio of vCPU to vRAM:

- Basic Usage – ratio 1:2
- All Purpose – ratio 1:4
- RAM Optimised – ratio 1:8

## Step 2: Select instance size

Depending on the selected instance type, there are different sizes to choose from:

#### Basic Usage:

Instance sizes:

- b4-8 – 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM – 0,22 €/Hour
- b8-16 – 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM – 0,44 €/Hour
- b16-32 – 16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM – 0,88 €/Hour
- b32-64 – 32 vCPU, 64 GB RAM – 1,76 €/Hour

#### All Purpose:

Instance sizes:
- a2-8 – 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM – 0,15 €/Hour
- a4-16 – 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM – 0,31 €/Hour
- a8-32 – 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM – 0,62 €/Hour
- a16-64 – 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM – 1,23 €/Hour
- a32-128 – 32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM – 2,46 €/Hour

#### RAM Optimised:

Instance sizes:
- r2-16 – 2 vCPU, 16 GB RAM – 0,24 €/Hour
- r4-32 – 4 vCPU, 32 GB RAM – 0,48 €/Hour
- r8-64 – 8 vCPU, 64 GB RAM – 0,97 €/Hour
- r16-128 – 16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM – 1,94 €/Hour
