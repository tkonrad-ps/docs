![FAQ Category Selection](../img/faq-select.png)

After selecting a category, the relevant questions for that area are displayed in a clear accordion layout.
Clicking on a question expands the corresponding answer to provide the requested information.
This functionality works the same way in all categories.
The accordion is only displayed after a category has been selected to maintain the pageâ€™s clarity.
