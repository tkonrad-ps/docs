## Service Status

The **"Service Status"** page provides you with an up-to-date overview of the status of your monitored systems and services. The information is displayed in two pie charts – one for hosts and one for services.

### Status display

The diagrams show the current distribution of the following statuses:

- **OK** – The system or service is working without errors.
- **Warning** – There is an indication of a possible bottleneck or deviation.
- **Critical** – There is a malfunction that requires immediate attention.
- **Unknown** – The status could not be determined.

**Important:**
Only systems that are monitored according to our current **Icinga2** standard are displayed.
