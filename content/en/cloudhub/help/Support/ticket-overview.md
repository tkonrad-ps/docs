## Ticket overview

On the **"Ticket overview"** page, you can view and manage all support tickets you have created.
The page is divided into two tabs and also offers the option to create a new ticket directly.

### Create ticket

At the top right of the page, there is a ‘Create ticket’ tile.
The button there takes you directly to the **"Create ticket"** page, where you can create a new support ticket.

### Open tickets

This tab displays all currently open tickets for your account.
This gives you a quick overview of all unresolved requests at any time.

### All tickets

Here you will find a complete list of all tickets you have created (regardless of their processing status).
This also allows you to access requests that have already been closed or completed.
