## Step-by-step guide to ordering products

### Step 1: Select a Product

![Select product in the sidebar](../img/ordering-products/beste1.png)

In the left sidebar, select the “Cloud Services” button and click on the desired product.

### Step 2: Start the Ordering Process

![Click on Order Now](../img/ordering-products/beste2.png)

On this information page, you can learn about the product's pricing, benefits, and optional services (e.g., onboarding workshop).  
To initiate the ordering process, click the “Order Now” button.

### Step 3: Fill Out the Order Wizard

The general structure of the wizards is as follows:

**Product-specific parameters**
- Region
- Flavor (e.g., CPU category, node size, ...)
- Project name / Username / Short description

**Billing and provisioning information**
- Which invoice should the product be billed to? The order can also be billed to a completely new invoice.


**Additional services**
- Onboarding workshop
- Consulting on topics like security or other helpful additional services

### Step 4: Review and Confirm Order

Here, the order parameters and the associated costs are shown again.  
If the order only generates usage-based charges, the price table can be accessed in the top right. Otherwise, the one-time cost is displayed under “Place paid order now”.

Before completing the order, the terms and conditions must be accepted.

### Step 5: View Order Status

The “Order Status” section now opens. Here you’ll find all products you have ordered through CloudHub, including detailed information.

On the far right, you’ll see the Actions column. Here, further actions are available. You can access the product interface and start working with the product right away.  
If you want to cancel the order or need help, you’ll be directed to the ticket module where everything can be handled.
