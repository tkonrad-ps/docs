The **"IP Overview"** page provides you with a complete overview of all IP addresses and network ranges assigned to your customer account. The page is divided into two tabs: **IP Addresses** and **Networks**.

### IP adresses

In the **"IP addresses"** tab, you will find a tabular overview of all IP addresses currently used by your products and services.

  You can use the search field above the table to search for a specific IP address or other properties.

- **Product and project links:**
  The table contains clickable fields:
  - **Project ID:** One click takes you to the [detailed view of the corresponding product](../../products-services-billing/products-services/#detailansicht).
  - **Product name:** Here, too, you will be taken to the [product detail page](../../products-services-billing/products-services/#detailansicht), where further information is provided.

The table also contains additional information, such as IP type (IPv4/IPv6), allocation status, and interface information, if applicable.

### Nets

The **"Networks"** tab shows all IP networks assigned to your customer account in CIDR notation.
