## Where can it be found?

The functionality can be found in the self-service portal, in the "Support" area under the "Service status" entry, directly next to the ticket area.

Visibility is not generally restricted, unless the user generally does not have access to the "Support" area.

## How is this feature organised?

There is a general overview of hosts and services, including a legend:
![Monitoring View - Übersicht](../img/monitoring-view/overview.png)
And you can view details of any faults for all hosts and services that do not have the "OK" status.
![Detailansicht zu eventuell vorhandenen Störungen an Hosts und Services](../img/monitoring-view/detailed-view.png)
